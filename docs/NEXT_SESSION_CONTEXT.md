## Last completed

**fund-stale-unknown-cleanup ([#247](https://github.com/ST5555-Code/Institutional-Ownership/pull/247), squash `0296107`) — flipped `is_latest=FALSE` on the BRANCH 1 portion of the stale-loader artifact surfaced by PR #246.** Builds on PR #246.

| Phase | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 1 — re-validate cohort | 8 (cik, fund_name) pairs / 3,184 rows / $10.025B at `series_id='UNKNOWN' AND is_latest=TRUE`; matches PR #246 audit (drift gate 0%). |
| 2 — dry-run manifest | New `scripts/oneoff/cleanup_stale_unknown.py` per-pair branch classifier. BRANCH 1 (live SYN_ companion → FLIP) = 6 pairs / 2,738 rows / $5.283B; BRANCH 2 (no SYN_ companion → HOLD) = 2 pairs / 446 rows / $4.741B (Adams ADX, ASA Gold ASA); BRANCH 3 = 0. **Calamos shifted from #246's HOLD into FLIP** — the v2 loader has since written `SYN_0001285650` (1,459 is_latest=TRUE rows). Phase 2 dry-run committed in pre-decision SHA `940576c`. Chat decision: BRANCH 1 only; BRANCH 2 deferred to new P2 `cef-attribution-path` workstream. |
| 3 — execute is_latest flip | Single transaction. `--confirm --accept-deferred-holds` (new opt-in flag for the BRANCH 2 deferral). Pre-flip 3,184 → post-flip 446 (Δ -2,738 == expected). All gates honored. |
| 4 — peer_rotation_flows rebuild | Run ID `peer_rotation_empty_20260502_095212` (parse 46.7s + promote 193.1s, ~4 min). Total 17,490,106 → 17,489,751 (Δ -355, 0.002%, well within ±0.5%). Snapshot at `data/backups/peer_rotation_peer_rotation_empty_20260502_095212.duckdb`. |
| 5 — validation | `pytest tests/` 373/373 PASS in 56.46s. `audit_unknown_inventory.py` re-run: residual 1 series / 446 rows / $4.74B (= 2 deferred BRANCH 2 pairs, expected). `audit_orphan_inventory.py` re-run: same 446 / $4.74B. `cd web/react-app && npm run build`: 0 errors, 1.41s. Per-pair `is_latest=TRUE` spot-checks: 6/6 FLIP pairs return SYN_-only; 2/2 HOLD pairs preserved as UNKNOWN. |

**Spot-check semantics (Phase 4):** `peer_rotation_flows.entity` is keyed on `fund_name`, not `series_id`. Same-fund_name pairs (Eaton Vance 242→121 rows, NXG 121→66 rows) cleanly de-duped from prior double-counting; case-different Calamos UNKNOWN-side entity (`'Calamos Global Total Return Fund'`) vanished while SYN_-side entity (`'CALAMOS GLOBAL TOTAL RETURN FUND'`, uppercase) unchanged at 127 rows / $47.6M.

**Architecture / safety:** UPDATE-only on `is_latest` flag. No INSERT, no `fund_universe` touched, no `series_id` rewrite, no synthesized SYN_ rows. PR-2 pipeline lock not on critical path. No write-path module modified. Apr-15 v2 loader bug surfaced in results doc but not patched (out of scope per brief).

**Output:** `scripts/oneoff/cleanup_stale_unknown.py`, `data/working/stale_unknown_cleanup_manifest.csv`, `docs/findings/fund_stale_unknown_cleanup_dryrun.md`, `docs/findings/fund_stale_unknown_cleanup_results.md`. ROADMAP.md adds COMPLETED entry + new P2 `cef-attribution-path` workstream.

**fund-unknown-attribution (PR #246, squash `1956ea8`) — read-only audit closing the orphan/unknown thread end-to-end.** Builds on PR #245.

| Layer | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 1 — surface map | `_fund_type_label()` at [scripts/queries/common.py:308](scripts/queries/common.py:308) is the sole NULL→'unknown' path; `cross.py` 3-way CASE arms emit NULL for the same gap. Other 'unknown' literals are `manager_type` fallbacks, not fund_strategy. No surprise paths. |
| 1 — master inventory | `fund_universe.fund_strategy IS NULL` count = 0. Display 'unknown' bucket comes entirely from holdings orphans: 1 series (literal `series_id='UNKNOWN'`), 3,184 rows / $10.025B / 8 distinct (cik, fund_name) pairs. Cohorts B/C/D from the brief are empty. |
| 1 — Cohort A reattribution | All 8 pairs map to existing SYN_ series (6 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 1 LOW, 0 NONE). Stale-loader root cause: Apr-3 legacy loader wrote `'UNKNOWN'`; Apr-15 v2 loader (e868772) wrote SYN_ companions but did not flip `is_latest=FALSE` on legacy rows. 5 of 8 pairs have BOTH versions live; 3 (Adams 'N/A', Asa Gold, Calamos) have only the stale UNKNOWN version. |
| 2 — three-lens validation | 296/301 PASS_ALL on PR #245 backfill cohort. 3 false positives, 1 known Blackstone override, 1 real reclass candidate: `S000090077` Rareview 2x Bull Cryptocurrency & Precious Metals ETF (currently `excluded`; classifier order says `passive` because `\dx` in INDEX_PATTERNS precedes ETF in EXCLUDE_PATTERNS; ~$0 net AUM). |
| 2 — completeness gap noted | All 301 orphan_backfill `fund_universe` rows have `total_net_assets=NULL`. Backfill flow populated `fund_strategy` only. |

**Output:** `docs/findings/fund_unknown_attribution.md` + `scripts/oneoff/audit_unknown_*.py` (3 helpers, all read-only — verified via grep). pytest tests/ 373/373 PASS unchanged.

**fund-orphan-backfill (PR #245, squash `9392a36`) closed the 302-series orphan exposure surfaced by PR #244.** Single PR, branch `fund-orphan-backfill`, backup carried over from PR-4 (`data/backups/13f_backup_20260501_103837`).

| Phase | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| 1 — re-validate | 302 series / 160,934 rows / $658.5B against current `data/13f.duckdb` (matches PR #244 audit). S9digit 301 / 157,750 rows / $648.5B; UNKNOWN_literal 1 / 3,184 / $10.0B. |
| 2 — dry-run manifest | 301 entries (300 majority-vote, all 100% support_pct + 1 manual override S000045538 Blackstone Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund → `multi_asset`). 0 SKIP-list matches in S9-digit cohort (Calamos / Eaton Vance both live under `series_id='UNKNOWN'`). Manifest at `data/working/orphan_backfill_manifest.csv`. |
| 3 — backfill | Single transaction. Pre-INSERT collision check passed (0 manifest series_ids existed in `fund_universe`). 301 INSERTs tagged `strategy_source='orphan_backfill_2026Q2'`. `fund_universe` 13,623 → 13,924. |
| 4 — peer_rotation rebuild | Run ID `peer_rotation_empty_20260501_235841` (parse 69.7s + promote 222.9s; ~5 min). Total 17,490,106 → 17,490,106 (Δ +0). Snapshot at `data/backups/peer_rotation_peer_rotation_empty_20260501_235841.duckdb`. |
| 5 — display layer | `cross.py` both 3-way `CASE` blocks now carry comment block tying NULL = unknown to PR #244 + this PR (behavior unchanged at SQL level). `_fund_type_label()` verified (already returns `'unknown'` for unmapped). `OverlapAnalysisTab.tsx` row filter (L194) AND active-KPI subset (L213) tightened to `r.is_active === true`. |
| 6 — validation | `pytest tests/` 373/373 PASS. Audit re-run: residual = 1 series / 3,184 rows / $10.0B (UNKNOWN_literal only, by design). PR-1d display contract validator: PASS. `npm run build`: 0 errors. 5 spot-checks all canonical + tagged. Blackstone override ✓. |

**Insert distribution (Phase 3):** bond_or_other 133 series / 119,701 rows / $558.7B; excluded 136 / 17,619 / $66.9B; passive 25 / 13,047 / $20.3B; multi_asset 1 / 7,152 / $2.5B; active 6 / 231 / $0.03B.

**This sync (direct to `main`):**

- **`ROADMAP.md`** — squash SHA `0296107` patched into the 2026-05-02 fund-stale-unknown-cleanup row.
- **`docs/NEXT_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`** — this file rewritten with PR #247 added at the top, PR #246 demoted below the divider.

Branch HEAD on `main`: **`0296107`** (PR #247 fund-stale-unknown-cleanup; flipped 2,738 rows is_latest=FALSE + peer_rotation_flows rebuild). Prior commit `dfa392e` (post-#246 doc-sync), then `1956ea8` (PR #246 fund-unknown-attribution audit).

## Up next

Two threads still queued; the user picks which to drive next session.

### 1. Architectural — `fund-strategy-taxonomy-finalization`

Review and finalize the five edge categories in the canonical `fund_strategy` taxonomy: `balanced` (60-90% equity, vague label, arbitrary boundary), `multi_asset` (30-60% equity, arbitrary boundaries on both sides), `bond_or_other` (heterogeneous bucket; the largest miscategorisation cohort — 39 ProShares short funds — was moved out by #243), `excluded` (combines money markets / fund-of-funds / ETF wrappers — should split into specific reasons), `final_filing` (status flag, not a strategy — decide whether it belongs in `fund_strategy` at all or should become a separate `is_terminating` boolean).

Output: findings doc with row counts per category, decisions list, recommended target taxonomy. Triggers now satisfied: orphan/NULL data is on the table; `canonical-value-coverage-audit` data-pull (PR #242 §1a–§1h) feeds this directly; orphan cohort backfilled (PR #245); BRANCH 1 of the stale-loader artifact flipped (PR #247) — only the 2-pair / 446-row CEF residual under `cef-attribution-path` remains.

### 2. Major sequence — institution-level consolidation scoping

Mirrors the four-stage pattern the fund-level arc established: backfill → rebuild → audit → fix + rename + lock. Different surface area:

- **Taxonomy decisions partially captured** (prior chat session, not yet executed): keep `pension`, `endowment`, `sovereign_wealth_fund` separate; merge `private_equity` + `venture_capital` → `pe_vc`; merge `wealth_management` + `family_office` → `wealth_mgmt`; merge `hedge_fund` + `multi_strategy` → `hedge_fund`. `mixed` and `unknown` still need review.
- **Data state to confront:** 1.4M+ parent-level rows in `holdings_v2.entity_type` carry legacy values (`active` / `passive` / `mixed` from old fund-level taxonomy). Canonical reads should hit `entity_classification_history.classification` / `entity_current.classification` instead.
- **Prerequisites:** `family_office` and `multi_strategy` migration from `manager_type` to `entity_classification_history` is a precondition for some merges.
- **Roadmap entry:** `parent-level-display-canonical-reads` (P2) — 18 read sites currently on `manager_type` / `entity_type` need migration; includes the `query4` silent-drop bug at [register.py:746-750](scripts/queries/register.py:746).

This thread gates the Admin Refresh System (the original project goal).

### Smaller items still open

- **per-fund-deferred-decisions** (P3) — Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income + 2 NEW global variants (all `balanced`); Calamos Global Total Return Fund (loader gap, 1,412 holdings rows under `series_id='UNKNOWN'`); 96-row N/A cohort. **Note:** Calamos / Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged were the SKIP-list patterns in PR #245 — they currently funnel into the literal `series_id='UNKNOWN'` sentinel (UNKNOWN_literal cohort, intentionally left orphan by PR #245). Resolution requires source-side rework (loader gap), not another `fund_universe` backfill.
- **unmerged-branch-decisions** (P3, both DELETE per chat) — `claude/reverent-kirch-c1fcdf` (PR #172 CLOSED, work shipped via #173) + `ui-audit-01` (PR #107 CLOSED, triage doc already on main).
- **stage-b-turnover-deferred-funds** (P3) — Vanguard Primecap / Windsor II / Equity Income (~$203B AUM) + Bridgeway Ultra-Small Company Market. Trigger: Stage B turnover detection design.
- **historical-fund-holdings-drift-audit** (P3) — 31,400 non-SYN drift rows. Snapshot semantics intentional; characterise the cohort for completeness.
- **canonical-value-coverage-audit** (P2, partially done in #242) — structured per-bucket count + AUM exposure + recommended treatment table is the still-open deliverable.
- **Stage 5 cleanup DROP** — authorized on or after **2026-05-09** per `MAINTENANCE.md`.
- **Q1 2026 13F cycle** — first live cycle expected ~2026-05-15 (45-day reporting window for period ending 2026-03-31). First live exercise of the locked `fund_universe` write path under a real cycle.

## Critical context for next session

**Fund-level data architecture is solid, locked, and now orphan-clean.** Single canonical column (`fund_universe.fund_strategy`); PR-2 pipeline lock (`_apply_fund_strategy_lock` + `_upsert_fund_universe` COALESCE); PR-4 JOIN-based query layer. Display layer reads canonical via `_fund_type_label()`. PR #245 backfilled the 302-series orphan cohort surfaced by PR #244; PR #247 flipped `is_latest=FALSE` on 6 of the 8 UNKNOWN-literal stale pairs (2,738 rows / $5.28B). Residual: 1 series / **446 rows / $4.74B** (2 closed-end-fund pairs Adams ADX + ASA Gold ASA, deferred to `cef-attribution-path`). 13 PRs validated end-to-end across the consolidation+cleanup+backfill arc.

**Snapshot vs canonical semantics are intentional.** Per-row, per-quarter classification at filing moment lives in `fund_holdings_v2.fund_strategy_at_filing` (snapshot, frozen by design). Canonical (locked, never-overwritten-without-analyst-approval) lives in `fund_universe.fund_strategy`. Anything that filters or buckets by active/passive **always JOINs `fund_universe`** — never reads `_at_filing`.

**Active-only views now exclude unknowns.** PR #245 tightened `OverlapAnalysisTab.tsx` from `r.is_active !== false` to `r.is_active === true` at both the row filter (L194) and the active-KPI tile (L213). Any fund with `is_active=null` (orphan from `fund_universe`) is excluded from active-only views. After PR #247 the only `is_active=null` source is the 446-row / $4.74B `cef-attribution-path` residual (Adams ADX + ASA Gold ASA).

**Institution-level should follow the same architectural pattern.** Canonical column on `entity_classification_history` / `entity_current`, constants module, shared label utility, JOIN-based query layer. The four-stage pattern (backfill → rebuild → audit → fix+rename+lock) is the template.

## Reminders

- **HEAD on main is `0296107`** (PR #247 fund-stale-unknown-cleanup — 2,738 rows flipped is_latest=FALSE + peer_rotation_flows rebuild). Prior commit `dfa392e` (post-#246 doc-sync), then `1956ea8` (PR #246 fund-unknown-attribution audit).
- **Canonical fund taxonomy values:** `{active, balanced, multi_asset, passive, bond_or_other, excluded, final_filing}`. `active` is dominant (was `equity` pre-PR-4). Display label utility `_fund_type_label()` in `scripts/queries/common.py` collapses to 5 values `{active, passive, bond, excluded, unknown}`.
- **Column rename (PR-4):** prod column is `fund_holdings_v2.fund_strategy_at_filing` (was `fund_strategy` pre-2026-05-01). Staging schema (`stg_nport_holdings.fund_strategy`) intentionally retains the old name — prod write path renames at INSERT time (`s.fund_strategy AS fund_strategy_at_filing`).
- **JOIN rule (PR-4):** for any active/passive filter, **always JOIN `fund_universe`** — the canonical, locked column. The per-row, per-quarter snapshot in `fund_strategy_at_filing` is preserved intentionally for snapshot semantics but is NOT the source of truth for filters.
- **Pipeline lock (PR-2):** `_apply_fund_strategy_lock` + `_upsert_fund_universe` COALESCE in `scripts/pipeline/load_nport.py` together prevent any `fund_universe.fund_strategy` overwrite once a series carries a non-NULL value. Three-branch semantics: new series → write classifier output; existing with non-null → preserve; existing with NULL → write classifier output (backfill case).
- **Constants module (PR-3):** `ACTIVE_FUND_STRATEGIES = ('active','balanced','multi_asset')` and `PASSIVE_FUND_STRATEGIES = ('passive','bond_or_other','excluded','final_filing')` adjacent to `_fund_type_label` in [scripts/queries/common.py:291](scripts/queries/common.py:291).
- **Display layer (PR-1d):** `_fund_type_label(fund_strategy)` is the single fund-level type emitter. Map: `active|balanced|multi_asset → 'active'`, `passive → 'passive'`, `bond_or_other → 'bond'`, `excluded|final_filing → 'excluded'`, NULL/unknown → `'unknown'`.
- **PR-1d gotcha:** `get_nport_children_batch` and `get_nport_children` in `scripts/queries/common.py` SELECT and propagate `fund_strategy` in their child-dict shape. Any new consumer can read `child['fund_strategy']` without re-querying.
- **PR-1d gotcha:** `cross.py` `_cross_ownership_fund_query` no longer carries `family_name` in its response (`type` overload removed). The column stays in `fund_holdings_v2` for entity matching.
- **PR #245 gotcha — orphan-backfill stamp:** the 301 backfilled `fund_universe` rows carry `strategy_source='orphan_backfill_2026Q2'`. Any future analysis of `fund_strategy` provenance can filter on this tag to isolate the cohort.
- **PR #245 gotcha — 3-way semantics:** `cross.py` `is_active` is tri-state (TRUE / FALSE / null). Frontend `OverlapAnalysisTab.tsx` now uses strict `=== true` at both L194 (row filter) and L213 (KPI subset). Other fund-level read sites (`get_two_company_subject`, `get_overlap_institution_detail`) that emit `is_active` follow the same convention. Don't reintroduce `!== false` truthy coercion — it silently rolls null into active.
- **PR #245 gotcha — UNKNOWN_literal residual:** `series_id='UNKNOWN'` is the literal sentinel where multiple historic fund_names funnel (Calamos Global Total Return + Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged + 6 more). 1 series / 3,184 rows / $10.0B. Left orphan by design — resolution requires source-side rework (loader gap), not another `fund_universe` backfill.
- **PR #246 gotcha — UNKNOWN_literal is solvable in-place.** Audit found all 8 (cik, fund_name) pairs map to existing SYN_ series with strategies already set. The orphan state isn't a `fund_universe` gap — it's stale holdings rows that need either (A1) `series_id` rewrite to SYN_ for the 3 stale-only pairs (1,858 rows / $5.07B: Adams 'N/A', Asa Gold, Calamos), or (A2) `is_latest=FALSE` flip for the 5 stale-redundant pairs (1,326 rows / $4.96B: Eaton Vance Tax-Adv, AIP, AMG Pantheon, NXG, Saba). Plus B1 reclass Rareview 2x Bull → 'passive' (1 row, ~$0 AUM) and B2 backfill `total_net_assets`/`equity_pct` for the 301 orphan_backfill funds (NULL across the board today). All 5 actions queued; none in #246.
- **#243 ProShares mechanics:** all 51 ProShares short / inverse / bear ETFs now `passive` end-to-end. The N-PORT holdings shape is uniformly swap notionals + cash/T-bill collateral (across both equity-tracking inverse like SQQQ/SH and treasury-tracking inverse like TBF). Morningstar classifies all three as "passively managed Trading-Inverse" ETFs.
- **#242 12 BlackRock muni trusts:** all confirmed merged Feb 2026 via Form 25-NSE delistings + BusinessWire merger-completion press releases. Post-merger NPORT-P (2026-03-26) and N-CSRS (2026-04-07) filings are residual administrative; trusts correctly carry `final_filing`.
- **Cross-Ownership tab (conv-22).** Peer dropdown reads `/api/v1/peer_tickers` (sector + industry from `market_data`). Investor row expand fires `/api/v1/cross_ownership_fund_detail?tickers=…&institution=…&anchor=…&quarter=…` and is gated by `has_fund_detail` on the parent rollup. Fund-level toggle pulls from `fund_holdings_v2` (pivot now references the outer `fund_pos` aggregation, not `fh.ticker` / `fh.holding_value`).
- **Git ops** (rule from conv-18, reaffirmed each session). Code merges PRs autonomously after CI passes: pushes branch, opens PR, waits for CI green, then `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` and pulls main. Reflected in `docs/PROCESS_RULES.md` §11.
- **Branch naming.** Always use a short descriptive slug. Claude must propose the short name before writing any prompt for Code. **Every Code prompt must start with the session/branch name on the first line.**
- **Doc-only commits (`conv-*`)** push directly to `main` — no PR needed.
- **Dark UI is production styling.** `docs/plans/DarkStyle.md` is the spec. Token palette + Hanken Grotesk / Inter / JetBrains Mono live in `web/react-app/src/styles/globals.css`.
- **Quarter formatting.** All quarter labels in the React app go through `fmtQuarter` from `web/react-app/src/components/common/formatters.ts`. `QuarterSelector` defaults to it. Oldest-left → newest-right ordering for quarter button arrays.
- **App is started from `data/13f_readonly.duckdb`** (last refreshed in PR #200, 2026-04-28 ~15:09).
- **N-PORT current to 2026-03 (partial — 3,379 rows).** 2026-02 mostly complete (476,173 rows); 2026-01 full (1,321,367 rows). Quarter labels reflect calendar convention (PR #213).
- **Do not run `build_classifications.py --reset`.** Same as previous sessions.
- **No `--reset` runs anywhere** without explicit user authorization.
- **Stage 5 cleanup** (legacy-table DROP window) authorized **on or after 2026-05-09** per `MAINTENANCE.md`.
- `other_managers` PK still pending — proposed `(accession_number, sequence_number, other_cik)` blocked by 5,518 NULL `other_cik` rows.
- **finra-default-flip:** scheduled 2026-07-23.
- **B3 calendar gate:** post-Q1+Q2 2026 cycles, ~mid-Aug 2026.
- **DM15e** (7 prospectus-blocked umbrella trusts) remains deferred behind DM6 / DM3.
- **PR #172** (`dm13-de-discovery`) PR CLOSED; branch flagged DELETE in `conv-24-doc-sync`.
- **Sector Rotation fund-view caveat** (from PR #215): `fund_holdings_v2.report_month` trails `quarter` by one period (filing-quarter convention). Anything that wants per-month detail for a filing quarter must look up the actual `report_month` values — do not derive months from the quarter label.
- **Overlap endpoint shape** (from PR #225): `/api/v1/overlap_institution_detail` returns `{overlapping, ticker_a_only, ticker_b_only}` (was `non_overlapping`). Each section capped at top 5 by value.

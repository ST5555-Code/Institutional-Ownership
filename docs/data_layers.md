# Data Layers — Table Classification

_Revised: 2026-04-17 (session #10) — Marathon session close. **`fund_holdings_v2` at 14,090,397 rows** (147K net added during 2026-04-17 Tier C re-promote; unchanged by session #10 entity-only work). **`promote_nport.py` + `promote_13dg.py` batch rewrite shipped (`6f4fdfc`)** — per-tuple DELETE/INSERT/CHECKPOINT loop replaced with single batch operations. Pre-rewrite DERA-scale promote ran 2+ hours per run; batch path now completes in seconds. **`_mirror_manifest_and_impacts` audit-trail wipe bug fixed** at the same time — staging impact mirrors no longer overwrite prod's `promote_status='promoted'` rows, and the post-promote UPDATE's broken `unit_key_json` IN-clause (passed Python tuples where JSON strings expected) is now correctly keyed via a TEMP dataframe. Future N-PORT re-promotes no longer need the SQL audit-trail reconciliation workaround documented in §Known data caveats. `investor_flows` 17,396,524 / `ticker_flow_stats` 80,322 / `summary_by_ticker` 47,642 / `summary_by_parent` 63,916 — all data_freshness-stamped post-promote. `make freshness` ALL PASS._

_Prepared: 2026-04-13 — pipeline framework foundation (v1.2)_
_Revised: 2026-04-17 (session #11 close) — 13D/G filer resolution (commit `5efae66`): 2,591 unmatched BO v2 filer CIKs processed via `scripts/resolve_13dg_filers.py` + `data/reference/13dg_filer_research_v2.csv`. 23 MERGE + 1,640 NEW_ENTITY + 928 prod-direct exclusions. BO v2 entity coverage 77.08% → **94.52%**; BO current 73.64% → **94.51%**. `entities` 24,895 → **26,535**; `entity_identifiers` 33,392 → **35,315** open; `entity_overrides_persistent` 204 → **245**; `ncen_adviser_map` 11,106 → **11,209** (+103 from DM15b scoped fetch `9ce5b17`). Prior revision header preserved below._

_Revised: 2026-04-16 (later) — 13D/G entity linkage shipped. Migration 005 + `bulk_enrich_bo_filers()` in `pipeline/shared.py` + `scripts/enrich_13dg.py` (commit `e231633`). `beneficial_ownership_v2` now carries `rollup_entity_id` / `rollup_name` / `dm_rollup_entity_id` / `dm_rollup_name` alongside the pre-existing `entity_id`; `beneficial_ownership_current` rebuilt with all 5 entity columns. First prod full-refresh: 40,009 / 51,905 rows enriched (77.08%); 66-row drift repaired; `data_freshness('beneficial_ownership_v2_enrichment')` stamped. Remaining 11,896 rows (2,591 filer CIKs) are 13D/G long-tail individuals/corporations outside the MDM — resolution via a follow-up `resolve_13dg_filers.py`._
_Revised: 2026-04-16 — Batch 3 closed. Three deliveries this week brought all L4 tables back into a clean rebuilt state:_
_  - `enrich_holdings.py` shipped (commit `559058d`) — `holdings_v2` Group 3 fully populated (ticker / sti / mvl / pof); `fund_holdings_v2.ticker` + 1.45M; `data_freshness('holdings_v2_enrichment')` stamped._
_  - `compute_flows.py` rewrite + `build_summaries.py` rewrite + migration 004 shipped (commit `87ee955`) — both scripts now `holdings_v2`-sourced and write rollup-aware tables (EC + DM worldviews); `summary_by_parent` PK is now `(quarter, rollup_type, rollup_entity_id)`._
_  - Entity MDM expansion (commits `e4e6468`, `7770f87`, `08e2400`) — 4,141 N-PORT pending series resolved; `fund_holdings_v2` 9.32M → 11.67M; entity layer at 24,347 entities / 33,234 identifiers / 55,138 rollup rows._
_  - All 4 L4 output tables stamped fresh on `data_freshness`: `holdings_v2_enrichment`, `investor_flows`, `ticker_flow_stats`, `summary_by_parent`, `summary_by_ticker`._
_Earlier 2026-04-15 work also live: CUSIP v1.4 layer (4 new tables + 7 new `securities` columns); N-PORT DERA backfill; control-plane tables; migration 002 (`fund_universe.strategy_*`)._
_Parallel 2026-04-14 workstream (commit 831e5b4) wired `record_freshness` on 8 non-v2 scripts and drafted `scripts/migrations/add_last_refreshed_at.py` (still pending on `entity_relationships`)._

This document is the single source of truth for how every table in the
prod DB is classified across the four-layer model. Each owning script
must stay within its assigned layer. A promote script for a table whose
DDL drifts from its owner-script INSERT is blocked until the drift is
resolved (see `docs/canonical_ddl.md`).

---

## 1. Layer definitions

**L0 — Control plane.** Pipeline machinery. Records what was fetched,
what passed validation, what got promoted, what is waiting on entity
resolution, and which migrations have been applied. Small, operational,
wall-clock-timestamped. Never contains analytical data.
_Tables: `ingestion_manifest`, `ingestion_impacts`,
`pending_entity_resolution`, `data_freshness`, `cusip_retry_queue`,
`schema_versions`._
_Pipeline writes here at every stage boundary._

**L1 — Raw.** Byte-level mirror of external source data — SEC filing
XML, FINRA CSV, Yahoo JSON — parsed into columns but otherwise
unmodified. Re-fetch is idempotent; a full re-parse must reproduce this
layer exactly. No joins, no enrichment.
_Tables: `raw_submissions`, `raw_infotable`, `raw_coverpage`, `filings`,
`filings_deduped`._

**L2 — Normalized.** Light shaping on top of raw: deduplicated, typed,
column-renamed. No cross-source joins, no entity resolution. A file that
passes L1 → L2 must be fully replayable from L1 without network access.
In practice this layer is narrow — most source pipelines skip it and
write directly to L3 staging because L2 and L3 for an accession share
keys 1:1.

**L3 — Canonical.** The authoritative fact tables the application reads.
Every row carries `entity_id` (and `rollup_entity_id` where applicable)
resolved through the entity MDM. Promote writes here are gate-protected
(see `scripts/pipeline/shared.entity_gate_check`) and go through
`staging_db → prod_db` via `sync → diff → promote`. L3 DDL changes
require a migration script; no ALTER TABLE at runtime.
_Tables: `holdings_v2`, `fund_holdings_v2`, `beneficial_ownership_v2`,
`securities`, `market_data`, `short_interest`, `fund_universe`,
`shares_outstanding_history`, `adv_managers`, `ncen_adviser_map`,
`filings`, `filings_deduped`, `cusip_classifications`, `_cache_openfigi`,
and the full entity MDM (`entities`, `entity_identifiers`,
`entity_relationships`, `entity_aliases`,
`entity_classification_history`, `entity_rollup_history`,
`entity_overrides_persistent`)._

**L4 — Derived.** Rebuilt from L3 by deterministic compute scripts. No
external fetch. Fully regenerable. Missing an L4 table never blocks a
pipeline run — it blocks only the downstream app tab.
_Tables: `beneficial_ownership_current`, `summary_by_parent`,
`summary_by_ticker`, `investor_flows`, `ticker_flow_stats`,
`managers`, `benchmark_weights`, `fund_best_index`,
`fund_index_scores`, `fund_name_map`, `index_proxies`,
`fund_classes`, `peer_groups`, `fund_family_patterns`,
`entity_current` (VIEW)._

## 2. Complete table inventory

Every table returned by `SHOW TABLES` on prod (counts below as of
2026-04-16) is classified. Entity `_snapshot_*` rollback artifacts from
`promote_staging.py` and `entity_*_staging` tables are grouped at the
bottom.

### Group 1 — Core 13F facts (owner: `promote_13f.py` [proposed], NOT NULL)

Written at promote time, sourced directly from the SEC filing. These are
the irreducible facts that define a 13F holding.

- `accession_number` — SEC accession (PK component with cusip)
- `cik` — filer CIK (zero-padded 10-digit)
- `manager_name` — coverpage-reported manager name
- `crd_number` — filer CRD if resolvable at promote time
- `inst_parent_name` — pre-rollup parent label (legacy; kept for app compatibility)
- `quarter` — `YYYYQN`
- `report_date` — filing report period
- `cusip` — CUSIP9
- `issuer_name` — infotable NAMEOFISSUER
- `security_type` — SSHPRNAMTTYPE
- `shares` — SSHPRNAMT
- `market_value_usd` — VALUE × 1000 (13F amounts are in thousands)
- `pct_of_portfolio` — `market_value_usd / SUM(market_value_usd) PARTITION BY accession_number`
- `discretion` — INVESTMENTDISCRETION
- `vote_sole`, `vote_shared`, `vote_none` — voting authority counts
- `put_call` — PUTCALL (if option)
- `fund_name` — parsed from coverpage where present

### Group 2 — Entity enrichment (owner: `promote_13f.py` [proposed], reads `entity_current`, NOT NULL)

Resolved at promote time from the entity MDM. Promote is blocked if any
required `cik` is not present in `entity_identifiers` with an active row
— see `entity_gate_check()`.

- `entity_id` — resolved filer entity_id
- `rollup_entity_id` — economic_control_v1 rollup target
- `rollup_name` — display name of rollup target
- `dm_rollup_entity_id` — decision_maker_v1 rollup target (for sub-adviser-aware views)
- `dm_rollup_name` — display name of dm rollup target
- `entity_type` — classification from `entity_classification_history` active row
- `manager_type` — derived from `entity_type` plus activist override; canonical app-facing type column
- `is_passive`, `is_activist` — booleans derived from classification + `entity_classification_history.is_activist`
- `classification_source` — provenance of the classification (ADV, N-CEN, SIC, manual_l4, etc.)

### Group 3 — Market/reference enrichment (owner: `enrich_holdings.py`, **LIVE** since 2026-04-16, NULLABLE)

Enrichment pass that runs **after** promote — NOT at promote time
(Decision D4). Nullability guarantee: queries.py must handle every
column in this group as potentially NULL. The shipped script
(`scripts/enrich_holdings.py`, commit `559058d`) uses a cusip-keyed
lookup pattern (NOT `(accession_number, cusip)` as originally
proposed — that key is non-unique on `holdings_v2` with 1.29M dup
groups; cusip-keyed lookup is verified 1:1 across
`cusip_classifications` / `securities` / `market_data`).

D6 **resolved** (option b): full refresh every run. Per-row `mvl` /
`pof` use the OUTER row's `shares`. Run with `--quarter YYYYQN` to
scope to one quarter.

- `ticker` — resolved from `securities` by cusip when `cusip_classifications.is_equity=TRUE`. Null when CUSIP is non-equity (OPTION/BOND/CASH/WARRANT/...).
- `security_type_inferred` — pulled from `securities.security_type_inferred` (legacy domain `equity/etf/derivative/money_market`); **not** from `cusip_classifications.canonical_type` (which uses BOND/COM/OPTION/... — different domain the app's read paths don't speak).
- `market_value_live` — `shares × market_data.price_live`. Null for delisted / foreign / non-equity / missing market_data.
- `pct_of_float` — `shares × 100.0 / market_data.float_shares`. Null when float is missing (~30% of `market_data` rows lack `float_shares`).

Live coverage on prod (2026-04-16, post first run): ticker 91.49% (10,395,053 / 12,270,984); sti 100.00%; mvl 77.64% (9,527,773); pof 61.83% (7,587,332).

- `is_restricted` — restricted boolean
- `payoff_profile` — derivatives payoff profile
- `loaded_at` — pipeline-set timestamp

### Group 2 — Entity + fund-strategy enrichment (owner: `promote_nport.py`, reads `entity_current` + `fund_universe`, NOT NULL for entity columns)

- `entity_id` — resolved fund filer entity_id via fund_cik
- `rollup_entity_id` — economic_control_v1 rollup target (fund sponsor)

### Group 3 — Reference enrichment (owner: `enrich_holdings.py` [proposed], NULLABLE)

Same post-promote pass as `holdings_v2`.

- `ticker` — resolved from `securities` by cusip. Null for bonds, illiquid, or unlisted.

## 4b. Column ownership — `beneficial_ownership_v2`

Prod DDL (2026-04-16, post migration 005):

```sql
CREATE TABLE beneficial_ownership_v2(
    accession_number VARCHAR, filer_cik VARCHAR, filer_name VARCHAR,
    subject_cusip VARCHAR, subject_ticker VARCHAR, subject_name VARCHAR,
    filing_type VARCHAR, filing_date DATE, report_date DATE,
    pct_owned DOUBLE, shares_owned BIGINT, aggregate_value DOUBLE,

);
```

### Group 1 — Core 13D/G facts (owner: `fetch_13dg_v2.py` + `promote_13dg.py`, mostly NOT NULL)

Filing facts sourced from the EDGAR Schedule 13D/G filing.

- `accession_number` — SEC accession (PK)
- `filer_cik` — reporting person CIK (zero-padded 10-digit)
- `filer_name` — reporting person name
- `subject_cusip` — subject company CUSIP9
- `subject_ticker` — subject company ticker (resolved at parse time
  via `securities` lookup)
- `subject_name` — subject company name
- `filing_type` — `SC 13D`, `SC 13D/A`, `SC 13G`, `SC 13G/A`
- `filing_date`, `report_date` — filing + event dates
- `pct_owned`, `shares_owned`, `aggregate_value` — reported position
- `intent` — categorical parse (activist / passive / arbitrage / etc.)
- `is_amendment`, `prior_accession` — amendment chain
- `purpose_text` — free-text Item 4 purpose
- `group_members` — co-filer list (joint filing)
- `manager_cik` — optional manager on whose behalf the filer reports
- `loaded_at` — pipeline timestamp
- `name_resolved` — flag for downstream name resolution

### Group 2 — Entity enrichment (owner: `bulk_enrich_bo_filers` in `scripts/pipeline/shared.py`, NULLABLE for unmatched filers)

Populated at promote time (scoped to the run's filer CIKs) and
refreshable via `scripts/enrich_13dg.py` (full refresh). Resolved
through the entity MDM via `filer_cik → entity_identifiers(type='cik')`.

- `entity_id` — resolved filer `entity_id`. Legacy-populated at ~77%;
  overwritten idempotently by each enrichment pass.
- `rollup_entity_id` — `economic_control_v1` rollup target.
- `rollup_name` — preferred alias of `rollup_entity_id`.
- `dm_rollup_entity_id` — `decision_maker_v1` rollup target.
- `dm_rollup_name` — preferred alias of `dm_rollup_entity_id`.

Nullability: unmatched filers (no active `entity_identifiers` row of
type `'cik'`) leave all five columns NULL. As of 2026-04-16, 40,009 /
51,905 rows (77.08%) are enriched. The 11,896 unmatched rows span
2,591 filer CIKs — 13D/G long-tail individuals, small corporations,
and activist investors not in the 13F-centric MDM. Follow-up:
`resolve_13dg_filers.py` for placeholder entity creation.

Unlike `holdings_v2`, BO v2 does **not** carry `manager_type`,
`is_passive`, `is_activist`, `entity_type`, or `classification_source`
— Schedule 13D/G disclosures are not manager classifications.

## 5. Option B split contract

**Option B** refers to splitting the promote vs enrichment responsibilities
so the pipeline can produce a valid L3 row *without* market data being
available. Group 3 columns are the split boundary.

**Split boundary columns:**
- `holdings_v2.{ticker, security_type_inferred, market_value_live, pct_of_float}`
- `fund_holdings_v2.ticker`

**Nullability guarantee:** these columns are allowed to be NULL in
production. `queries.py` must treat them as nullable in every read path.
Grep of prod `scripts/queries.py` confirms existing code already uses
`NULLS LAST`, `SUM(... market_value_live)` which naturally tolerates
NULL, and `COUNT(CASE WHEN market_value_live IS NOT NULL ...)` probes —
so the query layer is already Option-B-compatible.

**What must be true before Option B can be safely enabled:**

1. `promote_13f.py` sets `ticker`, `market_value_live`, `pct_of_float`,
   `security_type_inferred` to NULL on insert — never joins `securities`
   or `market_data` at promote time.
2. `enrich_holdings.py` runs as a separate step, owns an UPDATE that
   rewrites these four columns in place using a join to `securities` and
   `market_data`. Idempotent; safe to re-run.
3. Every query function that reads these columns continues to work when
   the value is NULL. Current grep shows ~40 references across
   `queries.py` — none dereference `.market_value_live` without a
   SUM/NULL-tolerant aggregate, and `pct_of_float` is always SUMed or
   compared with `IS NOT NULL`. Confirmed safe.
4. `enrich_holdings.py` writes to `data_freshness` with
   `table_name='holdings_v2_enrichment'` so the FreshnessBadge can
   surface enrichment-lag separately from ingest-lag.
5. The app still works when enrichment has not yet run against a
   freshly-promoted quarter — i.e., a just-promoted quarter shows
   Register / Conviction rows with null ticker/market_value_live and the
   tab handles that cleanly (degrades gracefully, doesn't 500). Covered
   today by the app's existing `NULLS LAST` + NULL-tolerant aggregates.

**Grep evidence (market_value_live + pct_of_float in queries.py):**
~40 occurrences, all inside `SUM(...)` aggregates, `NULLS LAST` ORDER
BY, or `WHERE ... IS NOT NULL` guards. No bare-deref reads in
record-shaping code. Option B is compatible today.

## 6. Open decisions D5–D8, S1

These cannot be resolved without operational data from the first few
framework pipeline runs. Recorded here so the orchestrator decision at
Step 18 has a concrete list.

**ID prefix convention.** `D#` is the pre-existing open-decision
namespace (D5–D8 below) and is aligned with
`ENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s entity-MDM D## deferred-items series.
**`S#` is a new prefix introduced 2026-04-18 for securities-layer
open decisions** (columns on `securities` / `cusip_classifications` /
`market_data`), to avoid cross-scope collision with entity-MDM D##
items. New entries pick the prefix that matches their scope.

### D5 — Entity retro-enrichment when merges change historical `rollup_entity_id`

**Decision needed:** When an entity merge (e.g. NorthStar eid=6693→7693)
changes the rollup target, do we retro-stamp `rollup_entity_id` in
historical `holdings_v2` rows, or carry the mapping in `entity_current`
only and let the app resolve at read time?

**Options:** (a) batch-rebuild affected historical rows at promote time
with a JOIN to the new `entity_rollup_history` open row; (b) keep
historical rollup as written, look up via view; (c) hybrid — retro-stamp
the last 4 quarters at promote, accept drift beyond.

**Why unresolved:** We need two or three promote cycles to measure
retro-stamp cost at 12.27M row scale. Current `build_entities.py --reset`
rewrite takes minutes; on-promote retro would need to be measured.

### D6 — `market_value_live` refresh cadence for historical rows

**Decision needed:** Does `enrich_holdings.py` refresh every historical
row on every run, or only freshly-promoted rows? Historical
`market_value_live` is a snapshot at enrichment time, not point-in-time.

**Options:** (a) freshly-promoted only — historical values frozen at
first enrichment; (b) full refresh every run — current behavior implied
by `build_summaries.py` design; (c) refresh latest quarter only, freeze
rest.

**Why unresolved:** Depends on app semantics. If "market value live"
means "what is the position worth today" the app expects (b). If it
means "what was it worth at quarter-end" the app expects freeze-after-
first-enrichment. Worth an explicit product decision, not a pipeline
decision.

### D7 — Snapshot table retention policy

**Decision needed:** `{entity_table}_snapshot_{ts}` tables accumulate in
prod — 16 snapshots of each of 9 entity tables = 144 tables pending.
Retention: 7 days, 30 days, keep 3, keep until next validation run?

**Options:** (a) drop any snapshot older than 7 days when
`promote_staging.py` runs; (b) keep last 3 snapshots per table, drop the
rest; (c) keep indefinitely until manual sweep.

**Why unresolved:** Current prod has 16 snapshots × 9 entity tables
= 144. At ~20k rows each that's ~2.88M snapshot rows — negligible for
DuckDB. But count will grow with every promote. Sweep script can be
added to `promote_staging.py` once we see natural cadence over 2–4
weeks of pipeline runs.

### D8 — L3 canonical DDL migration framework

**Decision needed:** How do we add / alter columns on L3 canonical
tables going forward? `ALTER TABLE` at runtime is not acceptable. The
options are: (a) numbered migration scripts similar to this session's
`001_pipeline_control_plane.py`; (b) full CREATE-TABLE-AS with rename
swap; (c) rely on owner-script DDL with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
plus column-diff additions in migrations.

**Why unresolved:** Need one real schema change to validate the chosen
approach. The `summary_by_parent` DDL drift (see `docs/canonical_ddl.md`)
is the obvious first candidate — the right fix is a migration script
that adds `rollup_entity_id`, `total_nport_aum`, `nport_coverage_pct`
columns to `build_summaries.py`'s `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, then a
rebuild. Once that ships, the pattern is proven.

### S1 — `is_priceable` semantic refinement for OTC grey-market rows

**Decision needed:** Define the precise meaning of `is_priceable` — and
what to do with rows OpenFIGI classifies as US-listed but which are
functionally non-priceable (OTC grey market, restricted listings, etc.).

**Options:**
- A: Tighten `is_priceable=TRUE` to exclude specific grey-market exchange
  codes.
- B: Add a separate column `is_actively_tradable` and leave
  `is_priceable` as an OpenFIGI response mirror.
- C: Treat residual grey-market corruption as classification error,
  fix in RC3 triage.

**Why unresolved:** Surfaced during BLOCK-TICKER-BACKFILL Pass C
`is_priceable` gate implementation. RSMDF (ResMed OTC grey) was flagged
`is_priceable=TRUE` but stamps foreign shape. Scope requires a look at
OpenFIGI's grey-market classification semantics before choosing
between (A/B/C). Tracked in ROADMAP as **INF29**.

---

## 7. Denormalized enrichment columns — drift risk and planned retirement

Some L3 v2 tables carry denormalized enrichment columns that answer
two very different questions. The columns look alike, but they are
semantically distinct — and only one class is safe to leave denormalized.

**Class A — filing-time facts.** Columns that answer "what did this
filer report on this date." The filing is immutable history; the
column is a stamp and should stay denormalized. Examples:
`holdings_v2.cusip`, `holdings_v2.shares`, `holdings_v2.market_value_usd`,
`fund_holdings_v2.report_date`, `fund_holdings_v2.cusip`. These never
drift.

**Class B — current-mapping lookups.** Columns that answer "what is
the current mapping for this key." The canonical source (a `securities`
row, an `entity_current` row, a GLEIF LEI record) can update after the
filing is stamped. The stamp then drifts. Examples:
`holdings_v2.ticker`, `holdings_v2.entity_id`, `holdings_v2.rollup_entity_id`,
`fund_holdings_v2.ticker`, `fund_holdings_v2.entity_id`, and (if ever
added) `lei`. These are the problem columns.

**Principle.** Class B columns should be joins, not stamps — resolved
at read time against the current canonical source. Class A columns stay
denormalized.

**Observed drift.**
- **BLOCK-2 entity_id backfill.** `fund_holdings_v2.entity_id` coverage
  moved from 40.09% to 84.13% after a one-time backfill pass against
  `entity_current`. The gap wasn't a bug — rows were stamped against
  the entity table as it looked at promote time; later entity merges
  and NEW_ENTITY creates left historical rows pointing at entity_ids
  that no longer represent the current mapping.
- **BLOCK-TICKER-BACKFILL ticker drift.** `fund_holdings_v2.ticker`
  was ~59% populated at 2025-06 and had decayed to ~3.7% at 2025-11
  before the backfill. Same mechanism: ticker stamped against
  `securities` at promote; subsequent ticker corrections in
  `securities` never propagated back.

**Planned retirement sequence.** Incremental — do not retire Class B
columns in one pass. Each step narrows the exposure before the next.

1. **BLOCK-TICKER-BACKFILL** *(shipped — `3299a9f`)*. One-time full
   backfill of `fund_holdings_v2.ticker`; forward-looking subprocess
   hooks at the end of `build_cusip.py` and `normalize_securities.py`
   so future `securities` updates trigger a ticker re-stamp. Keeps
   drift bounded, does not remove the column.
2. **BLOCK-3** *(shipped — `0dc0d5d`)*. Legacy `fetch_nport.py` retired;
   `build_benchmark_weights` + `build_fund_classes` repointed to
   `fund_holdings_v2`. Removes readers that would have been broken by
   a Class B column retirement.
3. **Batch 3 REWRITE.** Five remaining scripts still reading the
   denormalized Class B columns as their ground truth. Each one gets
   repointed to read through a join on `securities` / `entity_current`
   before the column can be retired.
4. **BLOCK-DENORM-RETIREMENT.** Drop the stamped Class B columns from
   v2 fact tables; rely on read-time joins. Tracked in ROADMAP as
   **INF25**.

**Not in scope.** Class A columns stay as stamps. `cusip` and `shares`
on `holdings_v2` are the filing-time record and do not join anywhere.

### COALESCE preservation pattern for source-side coverage regression

When a writer is repointed from one source to another and the new
source has lower coverage than the old, COALESCE preserves historical
values while letting new-source values win where populated:

```sql
UPDATE holdings_v2 t
SET manager_type = COALESCE(src.manager_type, t.manager_type),
    inst_parent_name = COALESCE(src.inst_parent_name, t.inst_parent_name),
    is_passive = COALESCE(src.is_passive, t.is_passive),
    is_activist = COALESCE(src.is_activist, t.is_activist)
FROM (<new source>) src
WHERE t.<join key> = src.<join key>;
```

**Precedent.** Rewrite5 Phase 4 (commit `7747af2`) applied this
pattern on all four `build_managers` enrichment columns
(`manager_type`, `inst_parent_name`, `is_passive`, `is_activist`).
The new source (`managers.strategy_type` populated by
`fetch_adv.py` + hand-curated
`data/reference/categorized_institutions_funds_v2.csv`) covers only
~60% of CIKs against legacy's 100%; the 40% gap is structural
(non-ADV filers, $25T+ AUM). COALESCE preserved legacy values in
that gap, including the 14-category hand-curated taxonomy that ADV
alone cannot supply.

**Auxiliary pattern: pre-rewrite snapshot as audit artifact.** Before
the COALESCE-repoint pass writes, snapshot the legacy column set into
a dated table — e.g. `holdings_v2_manager_type_legacy_snapshot_20260419`
(Rewrite5; 12,270,984 rows, 9,121 CIKs, 13 types). The snapshot is a
full point-in-time reference and supports:

- Rollback to pre-rewrite state without data loss if the new source
  turns out to be broken.
- Diff validation after the repoint — "how many rows changed, where
  did they land, and were the changes expected."
- Long-tail audit against future ADV enrichments — compare a fresh
  pull to the snapshot to see coverage drift direction.

**When to use.**
- Source-side coverage regression is known (the legacy source had
  more rows populated than the new source will).
- Legacy provenance is defensible — the legacy data was populated by
  a trusted process, even if that process has been retired.
- Taxonomies are strictly compatible: legacy is a superset of new, or
  the merge is semantically safe (e.g., new source refines legacy
  values rather than contradicting them).

**When not to use.**
- Taxonomies conflict — same column name, different meanings (e.g.,
  `status='active'` meaning "activist investor" in legacy vs.
  "actively-managed fund" in new). COALESCE would silently produce a
  meaningless mix.
- Legacy data is of unknown provenance — prefer a full-replace repoint
  so the column carries a single, auditable source of truth.

**Subsection cross-references.** `ENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md → Design
Decision Log` carries the dated rationale entry (2026-04-19);
`docs/REWRITE_BUILD_MANAGERS_FINDINGS.md` documents the Rewrite5
application of this pattern.

**Cross-references.**
- `ENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md → Known Limitations` carries a pointer to
  this section from the entity side.
- `ENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md → Design Decision Log` carries the dated
  rationale entry (2026-04-18).
- ROADMAP → INFRASTRUCTURE → Open items → INF25 carries the
  sequencing row.

## 8. Writers orphaned by Stage 5 holdings drop — observed pattern

Stage 5 (2026-04-13, BLOCK-3 preparatory work) dropped the legacy
`holdings` table. Three writers continued to target `holdings` for
writes after the drop, producing silent no-ops in prod. The pattern
is worth documenting: when a table is retired, downstream readers
break loudly, but downstream *writers* — especially those running
`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` + `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` — can fail silently
because the create succeeds and the write succeeds against a table
no other reader consults.

**Three documented instances.**

1. **`OTHERMANAGER2` / `other_managers`.** The registry declared
   `load_13f.py` as the owner of the `other_managers` write path, but
   the actual loader had never been implemented — parsed
   `OTHERMANAGER2` rows were dropped on the floor. Because no
   downstream reader joined `other_managers`, the gap went unnoticed
   until Rewrite4 Phase 0 addendum (commit `0a7ae35`) surveyed the
   registry vs. actual writes. **15,405 rows** were recovered from
   ghost data and materialized once the loader was implemented in
   Rewrite4 (commit `14a5152`).

2. **`build_managers.py` holdings ALTER+UPDATE (`:513-532`).** The
   manager enrichment pass ran `ALTER TABLE holdings ADD COLUMN ...` +
   `UPDATE holdings SET ...` after the core manager-table build. After
   Stage 5 dropped `holdings`, these statements targeted the legacy
   table name and ran silently every quarter with no observable
   effect. **100% of the legacy 14-category `manager_type` data was
   unpopulated on new data loads** between Stage 5 and Rewrite5
   detection. Fix: repoint to `holdings_v2` at commit `1719320`.

3. **`backfill_manager_types.py`.** A hand-curated backfill of manager
   types from `data/reference/categorized_institutions_funds_v2.csv`
   targeted the dropped `holdings` table. **5,782 curated rows** were
   silently not applied on each cycle between Stage 5 and Rewrite5.
   Fix: repoint to `holdings_v2` at commit `7b8a2b7`.

**Detection characteristics.** The pattern is silent at runtime:
`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS holdings; CREATE TABLE holdings AS SELECT ...`
succeeds (table name is usable again); subsequent `INSERT / UPDATE /
ALTER` against the recreated table succeeds; no reader joins it, so
the write has no observable effect. `data_freshness` stamps, when
present, go against the dropped table name and are themselves
orphaned. The only observable symptom is data-coverage regression,
typically caught by a smoke test or a manual audit, often weeks later.

**Mitigation going forward.** When retiring a table, audit all writers
named in `scripts/pipeline/registry.py` / `docs/canonical_ddl.md`, not
just downstream readers. The `pipeline_violations.md` doc already lists
`Legacy refs:` for each script — a table-retirement audit should treat
those lines as a kill-list: every `Legacy refs:` entry against the
retired table is a writer that needs repointing or deletion, not just

## 9. `promote_staging.py` promote-kind machinery

`promote_staging.py` carries two distinct promotion contracts,
selected per-table via the `PROMOTE_KIND` dict:

**`pk_diff` (existing behavior, default).** Diff staging against prod
by PK, produce `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE` statements, apply inside
one transaction with validate_entities gates. Safe when the producer
script writes individually-keyed rows with a stable PK — every
staging row corresponds to a prod row (present, absent, or updated)
determined by the PK alone. This is the contract used by all entity
tables (`entity_current`, `entity_aliases`, `entity_identifiers`,
`entity_relationships`, `entity_rollup_history`,
`entity_classification_history`, `entity_overrides_persistent`).
Preserves row-level history and supports precise rollback by replaying
the inverse diff.

**`rebuild` (new kind, added Rewrite5 Phase 0, commit `6079220`).**
Full-replace semantics: snapshot prod to a dated table, `DROP TABLE`
prod, `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` from staging, stamp `data_freshness`.
Safe for `DROP+CTAS` producer patterns where PK-diff is not viable
because staging row sets are not PK-keyed (fan-out from upstream
joins, dedup semantics that would treat perfectly-valid duplicate
keys as mutual deletions, or derived tables that are fully regenerated
every cycle and carry no historical state in prod).

**Registration.** Table-keyed `PROMOTE_KIND` dict in
`promote_staging.py`. Default is implicit `pk_diff` for backward
compatibility; tables that require `rebuild` are listed explicitly.

**When to use which.**

| Case | Kind |
|---|---|
| Staging row set has stable PK, diff semantics preserve history | `pk_diff` |
| Producer uses `DROP+CTAS`; every cycle fully regenerates prod | `rebuild` |
| Producer fans out via join + dedupe, dupes-on-PK are expected from the join | `rebuild` |
| Historical state must survive across promotes | `pk_diff` |
| Derived / materialized aggregates with no independent history | `rebuild` |

**Rewrite5 registrations.**
- `parent_bridge` → `pk_diff` (existing behavior preserved — history matters).
- `cik_crd_direct` → `pk_diff` (existing — history matters).
- `managers` → **`rebuild`** (new — DROP+CTAS producer, dupes-on-CIK expected from ADV joins).
- `cik_crd_links` → **`rebuild`** (new — derived materialization, no independent history).

**Snapshot retention.** `rebuild` snapshots land as
`{table}_legacy_snapshot_{YYYYMMDD}` dated tables and are retained as
audit artifacts. Precedent: `holdings_v2_manager_type_legacy_snapshot_20260419`
preserved the pre-Rewrite5 state of the `manager_type` column.
Retention policy open (see ROADMAP D7 — snapshot table retention
policy).

**Cross-references.**
- `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md §Batch 3-A` carries the sibling note on
  `fund_family_patterns` + `data_freshness` table additions.
- `docs/REWRITE_BUILD_MANAGERS_FINDINGS.md` documents the first use of
  `rebuild` kind.
- ROADMAP → INFRASTRUCTURE → Open items → `INF30` is the
  `merge_staging.py` analogue (NULL-only / column-scoped merge mode)
  for the seed-time reference-table layer.

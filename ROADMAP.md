# 13F Institutional Ownership Database — Roadmap

_Last updated: April 3, 2026_

---

## IN PROGRESS

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| P1 | Full 13D/G fetch — `fetch_13dg.py` | 57,612 unparsed filings in listed_filings_13dg. Awaiting authorization to run Phase 2 |
| P2 | `fetch_market.py` batch rewrite | Done — batch yf.download(), persistent cache (7-day), upsert-only. Needs production test |
| P3 | `compute_flows.py` set-based rewrite | Done — single INSERT per period via window functions. Needs production test |

---

## PIPELINE 1 — 13D/G Beneficial Ownership

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Amendment tracking | Done | `rebuild_current` uses ROW_NUMBER by filing_date DESC + amendment_count column |
| 3 | Crossed 5% threshold flag | Done | `crossed_5pct` boolean in beneficial_ownership_current via first_13g CTE |
| 4 | Intent change tracking | Done | `prior_intent` column via LAG() window function |
| 5 | `pct_owned` null improvement — tune regex for null cases | Done | Added 4 new patterns for 13D cover page format (Row 11, multi-line). 13G: 95.7% hit rate. 13D: structural gap (cover page layout) — new patterns improve coverage |

---

## PIPELINE 8 — Short Interest (FINRA)

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 9 | Short vs long comparison — same manager long 13F and short N-PORT | Done | `get_short_long_comparison()` in queries.py, `/api/short_long` endpoint. Matches 13F long parents to N-PORT short fund advisers |
| 10 | Short squeeze signal — high crowding + high short interest flag | Done | `get_short_squeeze_candidates()` in queries.py, `/api/short_squeeze` endpoint. Flags tickers with ≥15% short + high institutional ownership. Squeeze score = short_pct × inst/float |

---

## APP — Flow Analysis Tab

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 11 | Chart.js fix | Done | CDN present, setTimeout 100ms added, destroy-before-reinit in place |
| 12 | Run `compute_flows.py` after full fetch completes | High | Populates investor_flows table |
| 13 | Refresh readonly snapshot — `cp data/13f.duckdb data/13f_readonly.duckdb` | High | After compute_flows.py |

---

## APP — New Features (unlocked by short interest data)

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 14 | Conviction tab — short interest column | Done | `short_pct` added to query3 results from short_interest table |
| 15 | Crowding tab — short crowding overlay | Done | `/api/crowding` endpoint, top holders + short history table |
| 16 | Smart Money tab — net exposure view | Done | `/api/smart_money` endpoint, long by type + N-PORT shorts |
| 17 | Activist tab — short interest context | Done | `short_interest` section added to query6 return data |
| 18 | New/Exits tab — short interest available | Done | Short data accessible via Crowding/Smart Money tabs |

---

## INFRASTRUCTURE — Performance & Reliability

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| 19 | Centralize quarter config | Done | `config.py` created, imported by fetch_13f, load_13f, fetch_market, build_summaries, compute_flows. app.py SQL quarters need dedicated pass (60+ queries) |
| 20 | Incremental market data refresh | Done | `get_stale_tickers()` skips tickers fetched <7 days. `save_market_data()` upserts, never drops |
| 21 | Materialized summary tables | Done | `build_summaries.py` creates `summary_by_ticker` + `summary_by_parent`. --rebuild flag |
| 22 | Logged exceptions in app.py | Done | All bare `except Exception:` replaced with `as e` + `app.logger.error()` in endpoint handlers |
| 23 | Incremental `load_13f.py` — append + rebuild latest quarter only | Done | `--quarter 2025Q4` flag deletes+reloads single quarter from staging tables, then rebuilds filings+holdings from all data. Also added `--staging` and crash handler |
| 24 | OpenFIGI + yfinance persistent cache in `build_cusip.py` | Done | `_cache_openfigi` and `_cache_yfinance` tables, 30-day yfinance freshness |
| 25 | Readonly snapshot auto-refresh | Done | `scripts/refresh_snapshot.sh` — copies production to readonly with lock check |
| 26 | Benchmark script — time each pipeline stage | Done | `scripts/benchmark.py` with --run flag, stage timing, dry-run check |
| 27 | app.py quarter centralization — convert SQL strings to use config.py vars | Done | All 6 hardcoded quarter strings replaced with `{LQ}` / `{PQ}` variables. Zero hardcoded quarters remain in app.py |
| 28 | Pyflakes cleanup — unused imports removed from 17 scripts | Done | 31 unused imports fixed |
| 29 | SHOW TABLES removed from Flask endpoints — cached via `has_table()` | Done | 6 per-request queries replaced with startup-time cache |
| 30 | Snapshot switchback monitor — background thread auto-recovers from snapshot | Done | 60s polling, logs switchover |
| 31 | `queries.py` service layer — extract SQL from app.py route handlers | Done | 34 functions, 1,789 lines. app.py 2,362→618 lines |
| 32 | `export.py` — extract Excel export logic from app.py | Done | `build_excel()` + style constants, 83 lines |
| 33 | `run_pipeline.sh` hardened — process guard, timestamps, macOS notification | Done | pgrep check, phase start/end, osascript notify |
| 34 | Global SEC rate limiter — 2 req/s across all workers, Retry-After parsing | Done | `_rate_limit()` with shared lock, Phase 2 workers reduced to 2 |
| 35 | Phase 2 stall fix — reduced retry timeouts, per-future timeout | Done | Retry 3→2, sleep 10→5s, HTTP timeout 15→10s, fut.result(timeout=60) |
| 36 | `--phase1-only`, `--phase2-only`, `--phase3-only` CLI flags | Done | Each phase independently runnable and resumable |
| 37 | Crash handler on all fetch scripts | Done | db.crash_handler() writes traceback to logs/<script>_crash.log |
| 38 | Test isolation — `--test` uses `13f_test.duckdb`, write guard | Done | `db.py` centralized, assert_write_safe() |
| 39 | Bug 6 — fetch_market.py upsert, never drops table | Done | Unique index on ticker, delete-then-insert per batch |
| 40 | Bug 7 — app.py snapshot switchback monitor | Done | Background thread, 60s poll, auto-switch + log |
| 41 | Chart.js fix — setTimeout 100ms before chart init | Done | Lets DOM render canvas before Chart.js init |

## FUTURE — Performance & Stability Hardening

| # | Item | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-------|
| H1 | N+1 query fix — batch children in query1 | Done | 80+ queries → 2 queries. Parents + all 13F children fetched in single batched CTE |
| H2 | Batch yfinance calls in fetch_market.py | Done | Two-pass: batch `yf.download()` for prices (500/batch), then `yf.Tickers()` for metadata |

## SEQUENCE — NEXT STEPS

1. N-PORT index/ETF download running (`fetch_nport.py --staging --include-index`)
2. Merge N-PORT staging data → production (`merge_staging.py`)
3. Re-run `compute_flows.py` after merge
4. Refresh readonly snapshot
5. Build Short Squeeze UI tab (N2)
6. Add short/long comparison to Smart Money tab (N3)
7. Items N4-N10 as capacity allows
